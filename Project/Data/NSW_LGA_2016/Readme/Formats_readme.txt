# ABS DataPacks

ABS DataPacks are suitable for experienced Census data users who have their own database or analysis systems. DataPacks contain data for the main Census characteristics of people, families and dwellings for geographic areas ranging from a single Statistical Area Level 1 to the whole of Australia. Use DataPacks if you want Community Profile data for numerous geographic areas.

DataPacks are containers of Census data. They include metadata and reference documents to enable you to manipulate formats and read the data. ABS DataPacks contain no installable software and are intended to be loaded into, or viewed, using an appropriate system. Geography boundary files are available for you to map data to regions.

Metadata files contain the information you need to match the data with the Community Profile template, such as information about sequential numbers and labels, table descriptors, and the population that is being counted.
