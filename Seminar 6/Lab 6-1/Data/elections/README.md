# County-Level Presidential General Election Results for 2012 - 2016
Presidential election results for 2012 and 2016 from The Guardian and townhall.com. 

2012 election results at county-level are taken from results published in an Excel file by the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/07/us-2012-election-county-results-download#data).

2016 election results at the county-level are scraped from results published by [Townhall.com](http://townhall.com/election/2016/president/). Their well-formatted county-level result tables for the 2016 presidential general election makes it easy for a web scraper like beautifulsoup to capture results.

Credit to the web and data teams from The Guardian and townhall.com for investing resources to make these data available.
